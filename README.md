# Cryptex

This project is a 3d-printed prototype based on the "Cryptex" seen in the Da Vinvi Code roman (and film) by Ron Howard.

It was 100% imaginated (it was indeed the goal, to recreate the inside of a "black box" system like this one entirely by myself).

The files are all different parts of the global mecanism, thought with mecanichal work to enable the different parts to rotate correctly while staying right in place.
